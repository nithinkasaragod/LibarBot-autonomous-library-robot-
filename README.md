LiberBot is a Cartesian library assistant robot designed to automate simple book search and management tasks using an Arduino-controlled system. Unlike advanced robots that rely on AI or vision systems, LiberBot focuses on mechanical precision and user-friendly control, making it a cost-effective and practical solution for small and medium-sized libraries.

The robot is built on a Cartesian mechanism powered by stepper motors connected through a CNC shield, which allows accurate movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. This design enables LiberBot to reach specific shelves or book positions with high precision. Users can interact with the robot through an LED display and physical buttons, providing a straightforward interface to input commands or request book locations.

At its core, LiberBot is controlled by an Arduino Uno, which manages motor coordination, button inputs, and display outputs. A reliable DC power supply ensures smooth and consistent operation. The design is modular and easy to maintain, making it suitable for educational purposes as well as practical library assistance.

LiberBot simplifies repetitive tasks such as moving to a specific shelf, identifying book slots, and assisting users in locating resources. Its combination of affordability, simplicity, and automation brings smart technology into libraries without the complexity of AI-based systems.
